Certainly! I can help you practice the grammar points from Unit 41 of "Essential Grammar in Use". Unit 41 focuses on using **'too' and 'either'** in short responses, and also the structures **'so am I' and 'neither do I'**.

Here are 30 multiple-choice questions to help you practice, along with a hint for each and the correct answers.

### Hints and Answers

Here are the hints and correct answers for the practice questions, drawing directly from Unit 41:

**Hints:**
*   **'Too'** is used after **positive statements** to show agreement or addition [84, Section A].
*   **'Either'** is used after **negative statements** to show agreement or addition [84, Section A].
*   **'So + auxiliary verb + subject'** is used to agree with **positive statements** [84, Section B].
*   **'Neither + auxiliary verb + subject'** is used to agree with **negative statements**. Remember that after 'neither', the auxiliary verb should be **positive** because 'neither' already carries the negative meaning [84, Section B].
*   The **auxiliary verb** (e.g., *am, is, are, do, does, did, have, has, can, will, would*) used in the short answer or agreement structure must match the tense and verb form of the original statement [84, Section B].

**Answers:**

1.  **B) too**
    *   Hint: The statement "likes coffee" is positive, so use 'too' to add an agreeable positive statement [84, Section A].

2.  **B) either**
    *   Hint: The statement "doesn't like it" is negative, so use 'either' to add an agreeable negative statement [84, Section A].

3.  **C) too**
    *   Hint: "Is a doctor" is a positive statement. To add that this is also true for someone else, use 'too' [84, Section A].

4.  **C) either**
    *   Hint: "Didn't go" is a negative statement. To add that this is also true for someone else, use 'either' [84, Section A].

5.  **B) too**
    *   Hint: "Can play" is a positive modal verb. Use 'too' for agreement [84, Section A].

6.  **C) either**
    *   Hint: "Isn't married" is a negative verb. Use 'either' for agreement [84, Section A].

12. **B) So can I**
    *   Hint: To agree with a positive statement using "can", use "So + can + subject" [84, Section B].

    *   Hint: The statement "It's hot" uses "is". Use "so + is + subject" for agreement [84, Section B].

17. **A) Neither am I**

    *   Hint: The statement "My parents aren't home" is negative with 'be'. Use "neither + are + subject pronoun" to agree [84, Section B].

26. **A) So did I**
    *   Hint: To agree with a positive past simple statement using the "so" structure, use "so + did + subject" [84, Section B].
