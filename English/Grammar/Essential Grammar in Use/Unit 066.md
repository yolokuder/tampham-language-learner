You're now moving on to Unit 66 of "Essential Grammar in Use," which focuses on **countable and uncountable nouns**. This unit helps you understand how to use articles (like 'a' and 'an') and quantifiers (like 'some') correctly with different types of nouns, and how to form their plurals.

Here's a summary of the key grammar points from Unit 66:

*   **Countable Nouns:**
    *   These refer to things that **can be counted** [133A].
    *   They can be **singular** (referring to one) or **plural** (referring to more than one) [133A].
    *   When singular, they usually need **'a' or 'an'** before them (e.g., "a car," "an idea," "a flower") [133A]. You **cannot use a singular countable noun alone** without an article or other determiner (e.g., not 'I've got car', but 'I've got a car') [133A].
    *   When plural, they can be used with **numbers** (e.g., "two cars," "three men") or with words like **'some'** (e.g., "some flowers," "many cars") [133A]. You **cannot use 'a' or 'an' with plural countable nouns** (e.g., not 'a new cars') [133A].
*   **Uncountable Nouns:**
    *   These refer to things that **cannot be counted** as individual items [133B].
    *   They **do not have a plural form** (e.g., you say "money," not "moneys"; "music," not "musics") [133B].
    *   You **cannot use 'a' or 'an'** before uncountable nouns (e.g., not 'a money' or 'a music') [133B].
    *   They are often used with **'some'** (e.g., "some water," "some money," "some music") [133B].
    *   To refer to a specific quantity or a single item of an uncountable noun, you use phrases like **'a piece of...'** or **'a glass of...'** (e.g., "a piece of advice," "a glass of water," "a bottle of milk," "a cup of coffee," "a bowl of rice") [133B].

(Self-correction: While 'loaf' is common, 'piece' is directly from Unit 66's examples of quantification for uncountable nouns.

Unit 66 focuses on 'a/an' and 'some' for positive statements. Let's rephrase to stick strictly to Unit 66, which is about whether the noun is countable/uncountable and if it takes 'a/an' or 'some').
