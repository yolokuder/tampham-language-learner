### Hints and Answers

Unit 44 distinguishes between questions where 'who' or 'what' is the **subject** of the verb and questions where 'who' or 'what' is the **object** of the verb [90, Section A, B].

*   **Rule 1: When 'who' or 'what' is the subject** of the sentence, we do not use auxiliary verbs like 'do', 'does', or 'did'. The word order is usually **'Who/What + verb...'** (e.g., "Who saw Paul?", "What happened?") [90, Section A, B].
*   **Rule 2: When 'who' or 'what' is the object** of the verb, we use auxiliary verbs 'do', 'does', or 'did' (for simple present/past) before the subject, and the main verb is in its base (infinitive) form (e.g., "Who did Sylvia see?", "What did Paul say?") [90, Section A, B].
*   Remember that **'who'** is used for **people** and **'what'** is used for **things or ideas** [90, Section B, C].
