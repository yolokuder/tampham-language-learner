    A) What are waiting?
    B) **Who is waiting?**
    C) Who are waiting?
    D) Who do wait?
    *   **Hint:** "Who" replaces the subject "people." Even though "people" is plural, the question "Who is..." is common when asking about an unknown single person or a group acting as a single entity (implied subject reference). "Who are waiting?" is also grammatically correct for plural subjects, but "Who is waiting?" is often used when the exact number isn't known or implied. The example for unit 44 is "Who lives in this house?". Let's look at 43.1. "Are you eating?" [6A] indicates that "Are" would be used for plural subject. However, for "who" as subject, the unit emphasizes simple verb form (no auxiliary) or 'is' for continuous. The question "Who is coming?" [9.1.5] implies "who" takes singular verb when it's the subject.
    *   **Correct Answer:** B) **Who is waiting?**
