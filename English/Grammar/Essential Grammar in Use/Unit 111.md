Here are 30 multiple-choice questions to help you practice the grammar points of **Unit 111: "If..."** from your "Essential Grammar in Use" book, along with a hint and the correct answer for each.

Unit 111 primarily focuses on using **if** to talk about conditions and their results, especially concerning future events. Key points from this unit include:

*   The **if-clause** can come at the beginning of a sentence or in the middle. **When the if-clause starts the sentence, a comma (,) is typically used after it.** [27A].
*   When referring to **future events**, we use the **present simple** (e.g., *I go, you are*) after **if**, not 'will' (e.g., *I will go*) [27B]. This rule is similar to how we use **when** for future events, as discussed in Unit 110 [27C].
*   **"If" implies a possibility or uncertainty** (e.g., "If I go out" means it's possible I will go out, but I'm not sure) [27C].
*   This contrasts with **"when," which implies certainty** about a future event (e.g., "When I go out" means I am definitely going to go out) [27C].
