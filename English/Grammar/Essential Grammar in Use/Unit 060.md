You're ready to tackle Unit 60 of "Essential Grammar in Use," which focuses on **possessive pronouns** such as **"mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs,"** and contrasts them with the **possessive adjectives** ("my, your, his, her, its, our, their") [121A, 121B].

Here's a breakdown of the key grammar points from Unit 60:
*   **Possessive Adjectives vs. Possessive Pronouns**:
    *   **Possessive adjectives** (my, your, his, her, its, our, their) are used **before a noun** to show possession (e.g., "This is **my** book") [121B].
    *   **Possessive pronouns** (mine, yours, his, hers, ours, theirs) are used **without a noun** and stand alone, indicating who something belongs to (e.g., "This book is **mine**") [121A, 121B].
    *   **"His"** is unique because it is the **same form** for both the possessive adjective and the possessive pronoun (e.g., "This is **his** car" and "This car is **his**") [121A].
    *   The possessive form for "it" is **"its"** (an adjective), but there is **no possessive pronoun form for "it"** (i.e., no "its") [119C, 121A]. Remember the distinction from Unit 59: "its" (possessive) vs. "it's" (it is/it has) [119C].
*   **Asking about Possession**: We use **"Whose?"** to ask who something belongs to (e.g., "**Whose** book is this?") [121C, 121D].
*   **"A friend of mine/yours etc."**: This is a specific structure used to mean "one of my friends" (e.g., "I went out with **a friend of mine** yesterday") [121C].

Here are 30 multiple-choice questions to help you practice Unit 60, along with hints and correct answers:
