You're doing great continuing your English study with "Essential Grammar in Use"! Unit 70 focuses specifically on when to use **'to'** with certain places, and whether or not to include **'the'**. The unit clarifies that we **don't use 'the' with 'go to' when we are talking about the normal purpose or activity associated with places like work, school, hospital, prison, church, or bed** [141A]. However, **'the' is always used with places like 'the cinema', 'the bank', 'the doctor', 'the station', and similar specific public places** [141B]. A special case is **'home'**, which usually doesn't take 'to' or 'the' when used as a destination (e.g., "go home") or location (e.g., "stay at home") [141A].

Here are 30 multiple-choice questions to help you practice the grammar points of Unit 70:
