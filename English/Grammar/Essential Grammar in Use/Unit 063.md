You're studying Unit 63 of "Essential Grammar in Use," which focuses on the **possessive form using -'s and its variations**, along with the use of "of" for possessions related to things.

Here's a breakdown of the key grammar points covered in Unit 63:

*   **Possessive -'s for People:**
    *   The structure **noun + 's + noun** is used to show that something belongs to a person or to indicate a relationship [127A].
    *   For **singular people**, you add **-'s** to the noun. For example, "Ann's camera" means the camera belongs to Ann, and "my brother's car" means the car belongs to my brother [127A]. This also applies to relationships, such as "Kelly's wife" [127A].
    *   This form is specifically used for **people** [127A].

*   **Singular vs. Plural Possessives:**
    *   For **one friend**, you write "my friend's house" [127B].
    *   For **two or more friends** (or any plural noun ending in 's'), you write "my friends' house", placing the apostrophe after the 's' [127B].
    *   For **irregular plural nouns** that do not end in 's' (e.g., children, women), you add **-'s** to form the possessive (e.g., children's toys). This is implied by the distinction between "friend's" and "friends'" [127B].

*   **Using "of" for Things:**
    *   When talking about the possession or parts of **things, places, or abstract concepts**, you typically use the structure **"the... of the..."** instead of -'s [127C].
    *   For example, you say "the roof of that building" (not 'that building's roof') and "the beginning of the film" (not 'the film's beginning') [127C]. Other examples include "the name of this village" and "the capital of Spain" [127C].
