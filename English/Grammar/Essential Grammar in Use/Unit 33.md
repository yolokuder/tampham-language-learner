You're moving on to Unit 33, which focuses on the use of "**should**".

Here are the key points about "should" from Unit 33 of "Essential Grammar in Use":

*   **Should + infinitive** is used to express that something **is a good thing to do** or the **right thing to do** [70B]. It's essentially used for **giving advice or making recommendations** [70B, 70D].
    *   For example, "Tom **should go** to bed earlier" means it's a good idea for him to do so [70B].
    *   Another example is, "It's a fantastic film. You **should go** and see it" [70E].
*   **Shouldn't** (should not) means that something **is not a good thing to do** [70C].
    *   For instance, "You **shouldn't watch** TV so much" indicates that watching too much TV is not advisable [70C].
*   The strength of "should" is less than "must" [70E]. If you say "You **must** go and see it," it's a stronger recommendation or necessity than "You **should** go and see it" [70E].
*   **Ought to** can often be used as an alternative to "should" without a significant difference in meaning [70F]. For example, "You **ought to go**" means the same as "You **should go**" [70F].
