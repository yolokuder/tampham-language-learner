You're studying Unit 32, which focuses on the use of "**must**," "**mustn't**," and "**needn't**".

Here are the key points about these modal verbs from Unit 32:
*   **Must + infinitive** is used to express that something **is necessary** or that you believe it is essential to do [68B]. For example, "It's a fantastic film. You **must see** it" [68B].
*   **Mustn't** (must not) signifies that something is **not allowed** or that it is **necessary not to do** something [68C]. For instance, "You **mustn't touch** the pictures" means you are prohibited from doing so [68C].
*   **Needn't** (need not) indicates that something is **not necessary** [68D]. If you needn't do something, it means you don't have to, but you can choose to do it if you wish [68D]. For example, "You **needn't clean** the windows" means it's not essential to clean them [68D].
*   The distinction between **mustn't** and **needn't** is crucial: **mustn't** is a strong prohibition (do not do it), while **needn't** implies an absence of obligation (you don't have to do it) [68C, 68D].

Here are 30 quiz questions to help you practice the grammar points of Unit 32:
