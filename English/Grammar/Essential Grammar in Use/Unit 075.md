**Hint:** Unit 75 focuses on "some" and "any" as determiners. While "anyone" is related, "any" is the direct opposite of "some" here. However, based on the provided source for Unit 75, it only explicitly covers "some/any" with nouns or implied nouns. "Anybody/anyone" is typically covered in Unit 77, but "any" is the core principle here. To best fit Unit 75, let's rephrase this to focus on "any". If a direct person is implied: I didn't see **any** people. If the question implies things, it would be "anything". Let's modify the question slightly to fit "any" directly.
