Certainly! Unit 26 of "Essential Grammar in Use" focuses on using the **present continuous (am/is/are + -ing) for future arrangements**. This grammar point is used to talk about things that you have already planned or arranged to do in the future [56B]. It also contrasts with the simple present, which is used for timetables and programs [56C].

Here are 30 multiple-choice questions to help you practice the grammar points from Unit 26, along with a hint and the correct answer for each:
