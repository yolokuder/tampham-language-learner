Here are 30 multiple-choice questions to help you practice the grammar points of **Unit 108: "put on your shoes, put your shoes on (phrasal verbs 2)"** from your "Essential Grammar in Use" book, along with a hint and the correct answer for each.

This unit focuses on phrasal verbs that take an object [21A]. A key point is understanding where to place the object:
*   If the object is a **noun**, it can usually go **after the particle** (e.g., "turn on the light") or **between the verb and the particle** (e.g., "turn the light on") [21A, 21B].
*   If the object is a **pronoun** (e.g., *it, them*), it **must** go **between the verb and the particle** (e.g., "turn **it** on", NOT "turn on it") [21A].
