    A. a B. an C. the D. no article
    Hint: This unit primarily focuses on 'the' for specific, clear things. The specific usage of 'go to hospital' or 'be in hospital' without 'the' is covered in Unit 70 [23A].

Given Unit 69's focus on "the" when clear, and Unit 70 covering "go to hospital" without "the," I'll create a question that is clearly covered by Unit 69.
