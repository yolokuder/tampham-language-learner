17. He watches TV ______ eating dinner.
    A) before
    B) after
    C) during
    D) while
    *   **Hint:** Think about two actions happening at the same time. This uses 'while + subject + verb' or 'during + noun'. Here 'eating dinner' can be seen as a noun phrase referring to the event. The most natural fit to describe the activity happening simultaneously with TV watching would be 'while' if it was a clause, or 'during' if it's the noun phrase 'dinner'. Given the options and the specific phrase 'eating dinner', 'while' is more precise if we imply 'while he is eating dinner'. If it were just 'dinner', 'during' would be better. Let's assume the continuous action is implied. The source example uses "while I'm watching television" [2B] and "while we were eating" [2C]. So, 'while' is more direct for a continuous action.
    *   ****Correct Answer:**** D) while [2C]
