29. My sister lives **______** a small island.

    C) at
    D) about
    *   **Hint:** Reviewing Unit 99 (places 1) and Unit 100 (places 2) as background, 'on' is typically used for islands. While Unit 104 doesn't explicitly state this, it's a general 'on' usage not contradicted and often confused. (Self-correction: While the query is for Unit 104, some context from previous units may implicitly be tested, as shown by the exercises in the book linking units. However, to strictly adhere to Unit 104, I should avoid concepts explicitly from previous units unless they are revisited. Unit 104 does *not* cover general 'on' for places like islands, only specific uses like 'on holiday', 'on television'. I will re-do this question to *strictly* adhere to Unit 104 content.)
