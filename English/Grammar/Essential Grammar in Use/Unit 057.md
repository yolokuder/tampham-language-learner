**14.** How much money do you ____?
    A) have got [115A]
    B) had
    C) are having
    D) did have
    *Hint:* Questions about possession can use "do...have" or "have got." Option A implies a common question form used in the source for "have got" [115A].
    *Correct Answer:* **A) have got** (or B, but A is more direct for current possession with 'got') - The source explicitly shows "How much money do you have?" as a question [115A], and "How much money have you got?" [25C]. Given the options, "have got" fits as a direct question about possession. Let's re-evaluate. The source says **"How much money have you got?"** [115A, 25C]. And **"How much money do you have?"** [115A, 25C]. Both A and B are possible for the base form in a question for current possession. However, A is written as "have got", which means the phrasing is "How much money have you got?". Let's make sure the options are distinct enough. The question format is "How much money do you ____?". This implies the base verb. So "have" is correct.
    *Revised Hint:* The question structure uses "do," which means the base verb "have" is required [115A].
    *Revised Correct Answer:* **B) have**

**15.** We ____ a lot of fun at the beach yesterday.

**26.** I ____ no idea what to do.
    A) have got [115A]
    B) am having
    C) had
    D) have
    *Hint:* For fixed phrases like "have no idea," "have" is used for a state or possession of an idea [115A]. Both "I have no idea" and "I've got no idea" are common. Given the options, "have got" is most likely testing this common phrase.
    *Correct Answer:* **A) have got** (or D, but "have got no idea" is a strong common usage) - The source focuses on "I have a headache" and "I've got a headache" for illnesses, implying "have" and "have got" are interchangeable for possessions/states [115A]. "I have no idea" is similar to "I have a headache." So both "have" and "have got" are technically correct in meaning, but "have got" is often explicitly listed for such usages in "Essential Grammar in Use" to highlight its commonality. However, without "got" in the blank, "have" is the base verb. Let's assume the question is testing the general use of 'have' for a state.
    *Revised Hint:* "Have no idea" is an idiom expressing a lack of knowledge, similar to possession of an idea, and typically uses "have" or "have got" [115A].
    *Revised Correct Answer:* **D) have**

**30.** I haven't ____ enough time to finish the report.
    A) had [115A]
    B) have
    C) got [115A]
    D) doing
    *Hint:* "Have time" means possess time. In the negative, "haven't got" is a common way to express this, meaning "I don't have" [115A]. The past participle of "have" for "have got" is "had." So, for "I haven't got," the "got" part is what is missing.
    *Correct Answer:* **C) got** (This question tests the "have got" construction in the negative: "I haven't got enough time" [115A].)
