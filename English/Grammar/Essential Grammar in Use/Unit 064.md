You're looking to practice Unit 64 of "Essential Grammar in Use," which focuses on the use of **"a" and "an" with singular countable nouns** [129A]. This unit also explains when to use **"a" versus "an" based on sound**, and how **"a/an" is used to classify things or people**, including professions [129B, 129C].

Here's a summary of the key grammar points from Unit 64:

*   **"A" for Singular Countable Nouns with Consonant Sounds:** You use **"a"** before a singular countable noun that begins with a consonant sound. This indicates one thing or person [129A].
    *   Examples include "a camera," "a taxi," and "a beautiful day" [129A].
    *   It's important to remember that it's about the **sound**, not just the letter. For instance, "a university" and "a European country" use "a" because "uni-" and "Euro-" start with a "y" sound, which is a consonant sound [129B].
*   **"An" for Singular Countable Nouns with Vowel Sounds:** You use **"an"** before a word that starts with a vowel sound (a, e, i, o, u) [129B].
    *   Examples include "an apple," "an umbrella," and "an interesting programme" [129B].
*   **Using "A/An" for Classification and Professions:** You use **"a" or "an"** when you are stating what something is or what a person's job is [129C].
    *   Examples: "The sun is **a star**," "Football is **a game**," "Dallas is **a city**," "I'm **a dentist**," "He's **an engineer**" [129C].
*   **"Another":** The word "another" is formed from "an + other" and functions similarly [129B]. For example, "Can I have another cup of tea?" [129B].
