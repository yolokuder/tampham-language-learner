You're now on Unit 34, which covers "**I have to...**".

Here are the key points about "have to" from Unit 34 of "Essential Grammar in Use":

*   **"I have to do something"** means that it is **necessary** to do it, or you are **obliged** to do it [72A]. This obligation or necessity usually comes from **external circumstances, rules, or facts**, rather than the speaker's personal opinion [72D].
    *   For example, "I'll be late for work tomorrow. I **have to go** to the dentist" indicates a necessity [72A].
    *   Another example is, "Jill starts work at 7 o'clock, so she **has to get up** at 6" [72A].
    *   "You **have to pass** a test before you can get a driving licence" shows a requirement [72A].
*   The **past tense** of "have to" is **had to** [72B].
    *   For instance, "I was late for work yesterday. I **had to go** to the dentist" describes a past necessity [72B].
*   For **questions and negative sentences**, "have to" uses **do/does** in the present and **did** in the past [72C].
    *   **Present negative (don't have to / doesn't have to):** This means something **is not necessary** or you are not obliged to do it [72C]. For example, "I **don't have to work** tomorrow, so I don't have to get up early" [72C].
    *   **Past negative (didn't have to):** This means something was **not necessary** in the past [72C].
    *   **Questions:** "What time **do** you **have to go** to the dentist tomorrow?" or "**Does** Jill **have to work** on Sundays?" inquire about obligations [72C].
*   **Must** vs. **Have to**: While both can express necessity, there's a distinction [72D].
    *   Use **have to** when the necessity or obligation is **not your personal opinion**, but rather a fact, a rule, or an external circumstance. For example, "You **have to go** to the doctor" (because it's a fact you're sick), or "In many countries, men **have to** do military service" (because it's the law) [72D].
    *   **Must** is often used for the **speaker's strong personal opinion** about what is necessary or a very strong recommendation [72D, 70E]. For example, "It's a fantastic film. You **must** go and see it" [70E].
*   **Mustn't** (must not) means it is **necessary not to do something**, indicating a prohibition [68C]. This is different from **don't have to**, which means there is no obligation to do something, but you can if you wish [68D]. Unit 34 refers back to Unit 32 for this comparison.
