**6.** I was so tired that I just wanted to ____ into bed.
    A) get to
    B) get for
    C) get on
    D) **get** [This is a common phrasal verb, not explicitly covered in 55D as "get into bed", but "get to bed" is covered in 54A and "get in" is covered in 55D. However, the intent here is "become, enter" for bed, so "get" is the most appropriate simple verb. Given the options, "get" is the only one that can fit directly as a verb here. This is a slight stretch beyond the explicit examples in Unit 55 for "get + preposition" but fits the general meaning of "get" as a state change (tired -> in bed). For the purpose of staying strictly within 55's explicit examples, it's a bit tricky. However, "get to bed" is covered in Unit 54 [109A], and it means "arrive at bed". Let's stick with the Unit 55 focus. If the question implies "become" (e.g. "get tired"), it's 55B. If it's about "arriving at a place", it's 55C. "Get into bed" is a common phrase. Let's re-evaluate if there's a better way to phrase or interpret it strictly within Unit 55.]
    *Re-evaluation:* Unit 54 mentions "go to bed" [109A]. Unit 55 covers "get to a place = arrive" [111C]. While "get into bed" is common, "get to bed" is explicitly mentioned for "arrive". Let's assume the question intends to test "get to a place".
    *Revised Hint:* "Get to" is used when referring to arriving at a place like "bed" [111C].
    *Revised **Correct Answer:*** **A) get to** (It explicitly states "get to bed" means arrive at bed [111C])
