You are currently studying Unit 51 of "Essential Grammar in Use," which focuses on the correct usage of verb forms (infinitive with 'to' and the -ing form) after certain verbs and expressions.

Specifically, Unit 51 teaches that:
*   Many verbs are followed by the **infinitive with 'to'** (e.g., *want, hope, plan, decide, try* (meaning to attempt), *offer, promise, refuse, learn, need, forget* when it means forgetting to perform an action) [104A].
*   Other verbs are followed by the **-ing form** (e.g., *enjoy, stop* (meaning to cease an activity), *finish, suggest, mind*) [104B].
*   Verbs like *like, love, hate, prefer* can be followed by either the **-ing form** or the **infinitive with 'to'**. However, the **-ing form** is more commonly used when talking about general likes or dislikes [104C].
*   Expressions like *would like* and *would prefer* are always followed by the **infinitive with 'to'** [104D].
