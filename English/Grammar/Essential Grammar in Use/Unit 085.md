**Hint:** Some verbs, like 'look', are followed by adjectives to describe a state, not adverbs [168C]. This question indirectly reinforces the distinction from Unit 84, but is important for not misapplying the -ly rule. For the purpose of Unit 85, I will focus on verbs that take adverbs for *how* an action is done. *Self-correction: The query is specifically for Unit 85. Unit 85 focuses on adverbs modifying action verbs, not linking verbs like 'look'. I should rephrase this or choose another question.*
