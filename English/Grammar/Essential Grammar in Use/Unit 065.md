You're ready to practice Unit 65 of "Essential Grammar in Use," which focuses on **singular and plural nouns**, including their spelling rules and irregular forms.

Here's a breakdown of the key grammar points from Unit 65:

*   **Singular Nouns:** These refer to **one thing or person** [131A].
    *   Examples: "a flower," "a week," "a new place" [131A].
*   **Regular Plural Nouns:** Most nouns become plural by **adding -s** [131A].
    *   Examples: "some flowers," "two weeks," "many new places" [131A].
*   **Spelling Rules for Plurals (adding -es or changing endings):**
    *   For nouns ending in **-s, -sh, -ch, -x**, you usually add **-es** [131A].
        *   Examples: "bus → buses," "dish → dishes," "church → churches," "box → boxes" [131A].
    *   For nouns ending in a **consonant + -y**, you change the **-y to -ies** [131A].
        *   Examples: "baby → babies," "dictionary → dictionaries," "party → parties" [131A]. (Note: If it's a vowel + -y, like "day," you just add -s: "days" [131A, implicit from examples like "boy → boys"]).
    *   Some nouns ending in **-o** add **-es** [131A].
        *   Examples: "potato → potatoes," "tomato → tomatoes" [131A].
    *   Some nouns ending in **-f or -fe** change the ending to **-ves** [131A].
        *   Examples: "shelf → shelves," "knife → knives" [131A].
*   **Irregular Plural Nouns:** Some common nouns have **special, irregular plural forms** that do not follow the standard rules [131C, 131D].
    *   Examples: "man → men," "woman → women," "child → children," "foot → feet," "tooth → teeth," "mouse → mice" [131C].
    *   The plural of "person" is **"people"** [131D].
    *   The word **"police"** is already a plural noun and does not change form [131D].
*   **Nouns that are always plural:** Some nouns refer to items with two parts and are always used in the plural, often with "a pair of" for a single item [131B].
