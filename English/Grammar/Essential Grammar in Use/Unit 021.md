19. The new hospital ____ next year.
    A) builds
    B) is built
    C) will be built
    D) was built
    *   **Hint:** Although Unit 21 focuses on present and past simple passive, this question is a distractor. The time expression "next year" points to the future. If the question was strictly limited to Unit 21, none would be perfect. However, among the passive options, "is built" can sometimes be used for planned future events in an informal way (present simple for future), but "will be built" is more precise for future passive. Since the prompt asks for Unit 21, and the unit only covers 'is done' and 'was done', a trick question to test understanding of the *scope* of the unit. Let's assume the question intends to test simple present passive if the building is a regular event or part of a schedule, but "next year" makes it a one-time future event. Given the strict adherence to Unit 21, the best answer related to the structure (if we stretch the context) would be C for future, but that's outside the unit.
    Let me re-evaluate based on strict Unit 21 content. Unit 21 explicitly focuses on "is done" and "was done". A question about "next year" falls outside of this scope. I should either remove this question or adapt it to fit Unit 21.

    *Self-correction:* I must stick to Unit 21. I will replace this question.
