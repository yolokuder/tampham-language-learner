Here are 30 multiple-choice questions to help you practice the grammar points of **Unit 110: "When..."** from your "Essential Grammar in Use" book, along with a hint and the correct answer for each.

Unit 110 focuses on using **when** to connect two sentences, showing that one event happens at the time of another [25A]. Key points from this unit include:

*   You can start a sentence with **when** (e.g., **When I went out, it was raining.**) or put **when** in the middle (e.g., **It was raining when I went out.**) [25A]. If **when** starts the sentence, a comma (,) is typically used after the first part [25A].
*   When talking about the future, we use the **present simple** (I go, you are) after **when**, not 'will' (I will go) [25B]. This rule also applies to other time conjunctions like **before, while, and after** when they refer to future events [25B].
