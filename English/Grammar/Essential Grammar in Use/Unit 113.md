**Key Concepts from Unit 113:**

*   **Who** is used for people [31B]. For example, "A thief is a person who steals things" [31B].
*   **Which** is used for things [31D]. For example, "An aeroplane is a machine which flies" [31D].
*   **That** can be used for both things and people [31C]. However, for people, "who" is more common and usual than "that" [31C]. You should not use "which" for people [31D].
