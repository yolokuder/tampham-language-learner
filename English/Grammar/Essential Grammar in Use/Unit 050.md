You are currently studying Unit 50 of "Essential Grammar in Use," which focuses on the correct usage of verb forms after auxiliary verbs and certain expressions. This unit covers when to use the **infinitive without 'to'** (base form), the **infinitive with 'to'**, and the **-ing form** of verbs.

Specifically, Unit 50 teaches that:
*   You use the **infinitive without 'to'** after modal verbs like *will, shall, might, may, can, could, must, should*, and also after *do/does/did* in questions and negatives [102A].
*   You use the **infinitive with 'to'** after expressions such as *I'm going to..., I want to..., Everybody has to..., I'd like to...,* and *Dave used to...* [102B].
*   You use the **-ing form** for present continuous (*am/is/are + -ing*) and past continuous (*was/were + -ing*) tenses [102C].

Here are 30 multiple-choice questions to help you practice the grammar points of Unit 50:
