### Hints and Answers

Here are the hints and correct answers for the practice questions:

**Hints:**
*   For short answers, use the **same auxiliary verb** as in the question (do/does/did, have/has, be, can, etc.).
*   If the question is **positive**, the short answer (if negative) or question tag should be **negative**, and vice versa.
*   When using *do/does/did* for short answers or question tags, remember they are **replacing the main verb**.
*   For question tags, if the main clause is positive, the tag is usually negative. If the main clause is negative, the tag is usually positive.
*   Question tags use a **pronoun** that refers to the subject of the main clause.

**Answers:**

1.  **B) I do**
    *   Hint: The question uses "Do," so the short answer uses "do".
2.  **A) she doesn't**
    *   Hint: The question uses "Does" and the answer is negative, so use "doesn't".
3.  **A) they did**
    *   Hint: The question uses "Did" and the answer is positive, so use "did".
4.  **A) Did you**
    *   Hint: The statement is negative ("didn't work") and in the past simple, so the question uses "Did".
5.  **C) I have**
    *   Hint: The question uses "Have" (present perfect), so the short answer uses "have".
6.  **A) Has she**
    *   Hint: The statement is negative ("hasn't finished"), so the tag is positive, using "has".
7.  **B) isn't it**
    *   Hint: The statement is positive ("It's a beautiful day"), so the tag is negative, using "is".
8.  **B) can't you**
    *   Hint: The statement is positive ("You can play"), so the tag is negative, using "can".
9.  **A) do they**
    *   Hint: The statement is negative ("don't know"), so the tag is positive, using "do".
10. **B) aren't you**
    *   Hint: The statement is positive ("You're tired"), so the tag is negative, using "are".
11. **B) I haven't**
    *   Hint: The question uses "Have" (present perfect) and the answer is negative, so use "haven't".
12. **C) he does**
    *   Hint: The question uses "Does," so the short answer uses "does".
13. **A) did you**
    *   Hint: The statement is negative ("didn't lose"), so the tag is positive, using "did".
14. **A) was it**
    *   Hint: The statement is negative ("wasn't very good"), so the tag is positive, using "was".
15. **C) I do**
    *   Hint: The question uses "Do," so the short answer uses "do".
16. **A) she hasn't**
    *   Hint: The question uses "Has got" and the answer is negative, so use "hasn't".
17. **B) don't you**
    *   Hint: The statement is positive ("You live"), so the tag is negative, using "do".
18. **B) didn't he**
    *   Hint: The statement is positive ("Jim arrived" - past simple), so the tag is negative, using "did" and the pronoun "he".
19. **A) isn't it**
    *   Hint: The statement is positive ("It's dark"), so the tag is negative, using "is".
20. **C) Doesn't she**
    *   Hint: This is a direct question asking for confirmation, not a tag. Since "Margaret works" is positive present simple, the question uses "Doesn't she" for clarification.
21. **A) Have I**
    *   Hint: The statement is negative ("haven't got"), so the tag is positive, using "have".
22. **B) don't you**
    *   Hint: The statement is positive ("You like"), so the tag is negative, using "do".
23. **B) isn't it**
    *   Hint: The statement is positive ("This is"), so the tag is negative, using "is".

    *   Hint: The question uses "Did" and the answer is negative, so use "didn't".
26. **B) Didn't she**
    *   Hint: The statement "Sally went" is positive past simple, so the question uses "Didn't she" for clarification.
27. **A) was it**
    *   Hint: The statement is negative ("wasn't very good"), so the tag is positive, using "was".
28. **B) have you**
    *   Hint: The statement is negative ("haven't got"), so the tag is positive, using "have".
29. **B) doesn't she**
    *   Hint: The statement is positive ("Ann lives"), so the tag is negative, using "does" and the pronoun "she".
30. **B) won't you**
    *   Hint: The statement uses "will" (future), so the tag uses the negative form of "will" (won't) [83, Unit 28-29 on pages 60-63 (outside Unit 40, but relevant for understanding auxiliary verbs in tags)].
