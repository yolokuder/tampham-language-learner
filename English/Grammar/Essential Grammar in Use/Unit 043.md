### Hints and Answers

Here are the hints and correct answers for the practice questions, drawing directly from Unit 43 of "Essential Grammar in Use":

*   **Rule 1: Questions with 'am/is/are', 'was/were', 'have/has', or modal verbs (like 'can', 'will', 'could', 'must', 'should')**
    *   To form these questions, place the **first verb** (the auxiliary or modal) **before the subject** [88, Section A].

*   **Rule 2: Questions with 'do/does' (present simple) or 'did' (past simple)**
    *   When the main verb is not 'be' or an auxiliary 'have' (as in 'have got' or present perfect), use **'do' or 'does'** for present simple questions, and **'did'** for past simple questions [88, Section B].
    *   The **main verb** that follows 'do/does/did' must be in its **infinitive (base) form** [88, Section B].

*   **Rule 3: 'Why' + negative questions**
    *   To form these, use 'Why' followed by the **negative form of the auxiliary or modal verb** (e.g., isn't, don't, didn't, hasn't, couldn't) before the subject [88, Section C].
