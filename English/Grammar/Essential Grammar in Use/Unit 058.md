You're looking to practice Unit 58, which focuses on **subject and object pronouns** such as **"I/me, he/him, they/them"**, and how they are used for both people and things.

Unit 58 explains:
*   The difference between **subject pronouns** (I, we, you, he, she, it, they), which typically come **before a verb** (e.g., "I know Tom"), and **object pronouns** (me, us, you, him, her, it, them), which typically come **after a verb** (e.g., "Tom knows me") [117A].
*   How to use "it" and "them" when referring to **things** (e.g., "I don't like milk. I don't drink it." or "I don't like parties. I don't like them.") [117B].
*   The use of **object pronouns after prepositions** like "for," "to," "with," "at," etc. (e.g., "This letter isn't for me." or "Do you want to go with them?") [117C].
