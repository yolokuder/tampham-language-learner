Here are 30 multiple-choice questions to help you practice the grammar points of **Unit 112: "If I had... If we went... etc."** from your "Essential Grammar in Use" book, along with a hint and the correct answer for each.

Unit 112 focuses on **hypothetical or unreal conditions** in the present or future. These are situations that are **not real, not true, or not likely to happen** [29A, 29B].

The typical structure for these sentences is:
*   **If + past simple** (e.g., *if I had, if I knew, if we went, if you were*) in the 'if-clause'.
*   **... would (n't) + infinitive** (e.g., *I would buy, they wouldn't tell, you could be*) in the main clause [29A].

It's important to remember that:
*   "If I had the money" means **I don't have the money** [29A].
*   "If he knew the answer" means **he doesn't know the answer** [29A].
*   For the verb 'to be' in the 'if-clause', you can say "if I/he/she/it **was** or **were**..." [29B]. However, **'were' is often preferred** in more formal contexts or for general hypothetical statements like "If I were you..." [29B].
*   This unit contrasts with Unit 111, which deals with real or possible conditions in the future [27C, 29C].
