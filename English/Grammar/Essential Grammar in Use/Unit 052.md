You're on the right track with "Essential Grammar in Use"! My apologies, in our previous turn, I mistakenly referred to Unit 51's content. Based on the "Essential Grammar in Use" table of contents, **Unit 52** focuses specifically on the structure **"I want you to do"** or **"I told you to do"**, which means using a verb, followed by an object, and then either a 'to'-infinitive or a bare infinitive.

Specifically, Unit 52 teaches that:
*   Many verbs are followed by an **object + 'to'-infinitive** (e.g., *want, expect, ask, tell, advise, allow, persuade, teach, would like, would prefer, would love*) [106A]. The pattern is `verb + somebody + to do something` [106A].
*   Some verbs like **`make`** and **`let`** are followed by an **object + bare infinitive** (without 'to') [106C].

Here are 30 multiple-choice questions to help you practice the grammar points of Unit 52:
