You're studying Unit 31, which focuses on the use of "**can**" and "**could**". This unit explains how to express **ability, possibility, and make requests** using these modal verbs [66A, 66B, 66C, 66D].

Here are the key points about "can" and "could" from Unit 31:
*   **Can + infinitive** is used to express **ability** or that something **is possible** in the present [66A, 66B]. For example, "I can play the piano" means "I know how to do it or it is possible for me to do it" [66B].
*   The negative form is **can't** (cannot) [66A]. For example, "I'm too tired. I can't sleep" [66B].
*   **Could** and **couldn't** are used for the **past** [66C]. For instance, "When I was younger, I could run very fast" or "I was tired last night but I couldn't sleep" [66C].
*   Both **Can you...?** and **Could you...?** are used to **ask people to do things** (requests) [66D]. "Could you...?" is generally **more polite** than "Can you...?" [66D].
*   **Can I have...?** and **Could I have...?** are used to **ask for something** [66D]. "May I...?" can also be used for asking permission and is considered more formal or polite [66D].
