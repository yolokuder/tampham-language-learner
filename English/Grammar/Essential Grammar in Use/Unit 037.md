You're now moving on to Unit 37, which focuses on "**there was / there were**, **there has/have been**, and **there will be**".

Here's a breakdown of the grammar points from Unit 37 of "Essential Grammar in Use":

*   **"there was" / "there were"** are used to talk about the **existence of something in the past** [78A].
    *   **"there was"** (or **"there wasn't"** for negative) is used with **singular nouns** and uncountable nouns in the past [78A].
        *   Example: "**There was a good film on TV last night**" [78A]. "**Was there** anything to eat?" [79.2].
    *   **"there were"** (or **"there weren't"** for negative) is used with **plural nouns** in the past [78A].
        *   Example: "**There were 250 rooms**" [78A]. "**There weren't many people here**" [78A].
*   **"there has been" / "there have been"** are used to talk about **something that has happened or existed up to now** (present perfect) [78B].
    *   **"there has been"** (or **"there hasn't been"**) is used with **singular nouns** and uncountable nouns [78B].
        *   Example: "Look! **There's been an accident**" (meaning an accident has happened, with current relevance) [78B].
    *   **"there have been"** (or **"there haven't been"**) is used with **plural nouns** [78B].
        *   Example: "This road is very dangerous. **There have been many accidents**" [78B].
    *   This form emphasizes the **result or effect in the present** of a past event, whereas "there was/were" simply states a completed past event [78B].
*   **"there will be"** is used to talk about the **existence of something in the future** [78C].
    *   It is used for both **singular and plural nouns** [78C].
    *   Example: "**There will be a lot of people at the party on Saturday**" [78C]. "**There will be a new manager soon**" [78C].
