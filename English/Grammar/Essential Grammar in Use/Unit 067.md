You're diving into **Unit 67: a car / some money (countable/uncountable 2)** of "Essential Grammar in Use". This unit expands on the concepts introduced in Unit 66, focusing on the use of **'a/an'** with singular countable nouns, and **'some'** with both plural countable nouns and uncountable nouns [135A]. A key point in Unit 67 is understanding that **many nouns can be both countable and uncountable**, depending on their meaning in a specific context (e.g., "a paper" meaning a newspaper vs. "some paper" meaning the material) [135B]. The unit also highlights several nouns that are **typically uncountable** in English, such as *information, advice, weather, news, bread, hair, furniture,* and *work* [135C].

Here are 30 multiple-choice questions to help you practice the grammar points of Unit 67:
