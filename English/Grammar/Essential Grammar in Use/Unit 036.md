You're now moving on to Unit 36, which focuses on "**there is / there are**".

Here are the key grammar points from Unit 36 of "Essential Grammar in Use":

*   **"there is"** (or the contracted form **"there's"**) is used with **singular nouns** to state the existence of something [76A].
    *   For example: "**There's a big tree in the garden**" [76A]. "**There's a good film on TV tonight**" [76A]. "**Is there a hotel near here?**" [76A]. "**There isn't any snow**" [76A].
*   **"there are"** is used with **plural nouns** to state the existence of something [76A].
    *   For example: "**There are some big trees in the garden**" [76A]. "**Are there any letters for me today?**" [76A]. "**There aren't many people here**" [76A].
*   It's important to differentiate **"there is"** from **"it is"** [76B].
    *   **"there is"** introduces the existence of something, often meaning "a (noun) exists" [76B]. For example, "**There's a book on the table**" [76B].
    *   **"it is"** is used to **describe something already known** or to **identify what something is** [76B]. For example, if you like a book, you say, "**I like this book. It's interesting**" [76B]. If you hear a noise and want to identify it, you might say, "**What's that noise? It's a train**" [76B]. It also describes qualities, such as "**The train is very fast. It's a fast train**" or "**I don't like this soup. It's too salty**" [76B].
