### Hints and Answers

Here are the hints and correct answers for the practice questions, drawing directly from Unit 42 of "Essential Grammar in Use":

**Hints:**
*   To form negative sentences with **am/is/are, was/were, have/has, will, can, could, must, should, would**, you generally add **'not'** after these verbs. They can often be contracted (e.g., 'isn't', 'haven't', 'won't') [86, Section A].
*   For negative statements in the **present simple** and **past simple** tenses (when the main verb is not 'be' or 'have' in the sense of possession like 'have got'), you use **'do/does/did' + 'not' + the infinitive (base form) of the main verb** [86, Section B].
