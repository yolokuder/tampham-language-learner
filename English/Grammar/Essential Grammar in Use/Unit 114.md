Certainly! I can help you practice the grammar point of Unit 114 from "Essential Grammar in Use," which focuses on relative clauses where the relative pronoun is the object of the verb, and the use of **where** for places.

Unit 114 teaches that you **do not need to use who, that, or which when they are the object** of the verb in a relative clause [33A]. For example, instead of saying "The people who we met were very nice," you can simply say "The people we met were very nice" [33A]. However, if you do use a pronoun: **who** is for people, **which** is for things, and **that** can be used for both people and things [33A]. Unit 114 also introduces **where** for places [33C].

Here are 30 multiple-choice questions, each with a hint and the correct answer, to help you practice Unit 114:

Let's stick to the common options. **For the purpose of this quiz following the book's examples, "who" or "that" would be typically expected for object of person. Let me re-evaluate based on the examples in 33A, where "the people (who) we met" is shown, indicating "who" is acceptable as an object.**

    *   **Hint:** The source focuses on who/that/which/where. While "why" can be used for "reason," it's not explicitly covered in Unit 114. However, "that" can often be used after "reason." Let's choose the best fit based on the unit's focus on which/that for things, and the fact that "reason" is treated as a thing.
    *   **Re-evaluating for 23:** Unit 114 specifically covers "who," "that," "which," and "where". The concept of "reason why" is usually covered in later units or implies "reason (that)" [Not in unit 114 sources]. Given the options and unit focus, "that" is the closest fit if we treat "reason" as a thing [33A].
    *   **Correct Answer:** C) that (or `(no word needed)` is also implied by Unit 114 if it's the object) - Let's use **that**.
