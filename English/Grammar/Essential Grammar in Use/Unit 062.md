You're focusing on Unit 62 of "Essential Grammar in Use," which covers **reflexive pronouns (myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves)** and the distinction between these and object pronouns, as well as the use of "by myself" and "each other".

Here's a summary of the key distinctions covered in Unit 62:

*   **Reflexive Pronouns (myself, yourself, himself, herself, itself, ourselves, yourselves, themselves)**:
    *   These pronouns are used when the **action of the verb is performed by the subject upon the subject itself** [125A]. This means the subject and the object of the verb are the same person or thing [125A].
    *   Examples: "He looked at **himself** in the mirror" (He is the subject, and he is also the one being looked at) [125A, 125B].
    *   They are also used after prepositions when the subject and the object of the preposition are the same [125B].
    *   The unit provides a table illustrating the pairs: I → myself, he → himself, she → herself, you → yourself, we → ourselves, you (plural) → yourselves, they → themselves, it → itself [125A].

*   **Distinguishing Reflexive Pronouns from Object Pronouns (me, him, her, us, them, you, it)**:
    *   Use an **object pronoun** when the action is done **to someone or something else** [125B].
    *   Example: "She is looking at **him**" (different people) versus "She is looking at **herself**" (the same person) [125B].

*   **"By myself / by yourself / etc."**:
    *   This phrase means "**alone**" or "without anyone else" [125C].
    *   Example: "I went on holiday **by myself**" means "I went on holiday alone" [125C].

*   **"Each other" vs. Reflexive Pronouns**:
    *   **"Each other"** is used when **two or more people or things do something to one another** [125D]. It indicates a reciprocal action.
    *   Example: "Jill and Ann are good friends. They know **each other** well" (Jill knows Ann and Ann knows Jill) [125D].
    *   Contrast this with a reflexive pronoun: "Steve and Sue looked at **themselves**" (meaning Steve looked at Steve, and Sue looked at Sue, e.g., in a mirror) [125D].
