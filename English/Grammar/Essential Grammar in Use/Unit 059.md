You're looking to practice Unit 59 of "Essential Grammar in Use," which focuses on **possessive adjectives** like **"my, your, his, her, its, our, their"** [119A].

Unit 59 explains:
*   These words are **possessive adjectives** and they typically come **before a noun** to show who something belongs to (e.g., "my hat," "your job," "his bicycle," "her car," "its university," "our house," "their room") [119A, 119B].
*   It also highlights the important distinction between **"its"** (the possessive form for things, e.g., "Oxford is famous for its university") and **"it's"** (a contraction meaning "it is" or "it has," e.g., "It's a nice city. (= It is a nice city.)") [119C].
