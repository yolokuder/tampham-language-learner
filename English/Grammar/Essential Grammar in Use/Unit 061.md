You're focusing on Unit 61 of "Essential Grammar in Use," which delves into the usage of **"I/me/my/mine" and similar pronoun groups**, helping you distinguish between subject pronouns, object pronouns, possessive adjectives, and possessive pronouns.

Here's a summary of the key distinctions covered in Unit 61:
*   **Subject Pronouns (I, we, you, he, she, they)**: These pronouns act as the **subject of a verb**. They typically come *before* the verb. For example, "**I** know Tom" or "**He** knows Tom".
*   **Object Pronouns (me, us, you, him, her, them)**: These pronouns act as the **object of a verb** or come **after a preposition**. For example, "Tom knows **me**" (after a verb) or "We invited her to stay with **us**" (after a preposition).
*   **Possessive Adjectives (my, our, your, his, her, their)**: These are used **before a noun** to show possession. For example, "It's **my** car" or "It's **her** car".
*   **Possessive Pronouns (mine, ours, yours, his, hers, theirs)**: These stand **alone** and are used **without a noun** to show possession. For example, "It's **mine**" or "It's **hers**".
*   **Special case of "his"**: The word "his" is unique because it functions as **both a possessive adjective and a possessive pronoun**. For instance, "It's **his** car" (adjective) and "It's **his**" (pronoun).
