Based on the exercises provided for **Unit 39: "I am / I don't etc."** in "Essential Grammar in Use 2nd Edition by R. Murphy", this unit focuses on using **auxiliary verbs** (such as *am/is/are, was/were, have/has, do/does/did, can/can't*) in **short answers** or to **avoid repeating the main verb** in a sentence. While the main instructional page for Unit 39 is not provided in the sources, the exercises on page 82 clearly demonstrate these grammatical points.

Here are 30 quiz questions designed to help you practice the grammar points of Unit 39, along with a hint for each and the correct answer.

### Unit 39 Grammar Quiz: I am / I don't etc.

1.  **He wasn't feeling well, but now he _______.**
    A) is
    B) does
    C) has
    D) can
    *   **Hint:** The first part of the sentence uses a form of "be" (wasn't) and refers to a current state. Choose the correct present tense auxiliary for "he" to contrast the past.
    *   **Correct Answer:** A) is [82, 39.1]

2.  **She doesn't like coffee, but her sister _______.**
    A) is
    B) does
    C) has
    D) can
    *   **Hint:** The first part of the sentence uses "doesn't like," indicating a present simple negative. Choose the correct auxiliary for present simple to show contrast.
    *   **Correct Answer:** B) does [82, 39.3]

3.  **They haven't finished yet, but they ______ soon.**
    A) are
    B) do
    C) have
    D) will
    *   **Hint:** The sentence uses "haven't finished" (present perfect). Think about the auxiliary used for future actions that are expected to happen.
    *   **Correct Answer:** D) will (This option is outside the direct scope of Unit 39 exercises which focus on `be, have, do, can` but common in short answers. Based on the explicit exercises, `have` would be more direct, but "will" is a common auxiliary for expected future actions, which could be inferred. Let's re-evaluate based on strict source adherence. Unit 39 exercises focus on `is/have/can/do` based on 39.1, 39.2, 39.3, 39.4, 39.5, 39.6. None of these use "will" directly. I should stick to the explicit auxiliaries shown in the exercises.)

    *Re-evaluation for Q3:* The provided Unit 39 exercises primarily cover short answers with `be`, `have`, `can`, and `do` in present and past tenses. There is no explicit mention or exercise related to `will`. Therefore, I should rephrase this question or use an auxiliary that is clearly demonstrated.

    Let's rephrase Q3 to fit the demonstrated auxiliaries:

3.  **They haven't started the project, but they ______ most of the work.**
    A) are
    B) do
    C) have
    D) did
    *   **Hint:** The first part uses "haven't started" (present perfect). The second part implies that despite not starting, they have completed a significant portion of work, requiring a contrasting auxiliary verb related to the act of doing.
    *   **Correct Answer:** C) have (as in "they have [done] most of the work," implying present perfect continuation from the first part of the sentence, or simple present `do` for habit, but `have` is more likely here as an auxiliary for present perfect implying completed action.)

    *Self-correction for Q3:* The prompt specifically mentioned "I am / I don't etc.". The exercises show `is/have/can/do`.
    Let's re-align Q3 to be about "have" as an auxiliary.
    **They haven't eaten breakfast yet, but they _______ lunch.**
    A) are
    B) do
    C) have
    D) did
    *   **Hint:** The first part uses "haven't eaten" (present perfect). The second part requires an auxiliary that contrasts with the first, showing a completed action related to eating.
    *   **Correct Answer:** C) have (as in "they have [eaten] lunch") [82, 39.5, 39.6 - general "have" short answers]. This fits better with the demonstrated uses of `have` in Unit 39.

4.  **Are you cold? No, I ______.**
    A) don't
    B) haven't
    C) isn't
    D) am not
    *   **Hint:** The question starts with "Are you...". The short answer should use the same auxiliary verb.
    *   **Correct Answer:** D) am not [82, 39.6]

5.  **He can play the guitar, but I _______.**
    A) don't
    B) can't
    C) am not
    D) haven't
    *   **Hint:** The first part uses the modal verb "can". The second part expresses an inability to do the same.
    *   **Correct Answer:** B) can't [82, 39.2]

6.  **Did you enjoy the party? Yes, I _______.**
    A) did
    B) have
    C) am
    D) can
    *   **Hint:** The question uses the past simple auxiliary "Did". The short answer should match.
    *   **Correct Answer:** A) did [82, 39.4, 39.6]

7.  **She was tired, but now she _______.**
    A) isn't
    B) wasn't
    C) doesn't
    D) hasn't
    *   **Hint:** The first part uses "was" (past tense of be). The second part implies she is no longer tired, requiring a contrasting present tense auxiliary of "be".
    *   **Correct Answer:** A) isn't [82, 39.5, 39.1]

8.  **I don't usually watch TV, but sometimes I _______.**
    A) am
    B) do
    C) have
    D) can
    *   **Hint:** The sentence talks about a usual action using "don't watch" (present simple). Use the appropriate auxiliary to show a contrasting habit.
    *   **Correct Answer:** B) do [82, 39.3]

9.  **They had a great time, ______ they?**
    A) did
    B) didn't
    C) had
    D) hadn't
    *   **Hint:** This is a tag question. The main verb "had" is in the past simple. The tag should use the past simple auxiliary in the opposite form.
    *   **Correct Answer:** B) didn't (This is implied by the use of `do/did` in 39.3/39.4, for negative questions or short answers, though tag questions aren't explicitly shown. It's a natural extension of using `did` for past simple.)

10. **He hasn't got much money, but his brother _______.**
    A) does
    B) is
    C) has
    D) can
    *   **Hint:** The sentence uses "hasn't got" (present perfect for possession). Use the appropriate auxiliary to show contrast.
    *   **Correct Answer:** C) has [82, 39.5]

11. **Are they studying English? Yes, they _______.**
    A) do
    B) are
    C) have
    D) can
    *   **Hint:** The question uses "Are they...". The short answer should match.
    *   **Correct Answer:** B) are [82, 39.6]

12. **You should call him, but you ______ to.**
    A) don't have
    B) aren't
    C) haven't
    D) shouldn't
    *   **Hint:** The first part suggests an obligation. The second part implies there is no obligation. Use the negative form of "have to". (While "shouldn't" is also possible, the structure points to "do" as an auxiliary).
    *   **Correct Answer:** A) don't have (This involves "have to", which is a semi-modal covered in Unit 34. The exercises in Unit 39 explicitly use "do/does/did" for present/past simple. So, "don't" is the auxiliary here. The question is slightly complex as it's not just a simple auxiliary verb repetition.)

    *Re-evaluation for Q12:* The question uses "should", which is a modal verb covered in Unit 33. Unit 39's focus is on short answers with `am/is/are, have/has, do/does/did, can/can't`. So, a question involving "should" might be outside the direct scope of Unit 39's exercises. Let's rephrase this one to stick to the demonstrated auxiliaries.

    **She can't swim very well, but her brother _______.**
    A) does
    B) is
    C) can
    D) has
