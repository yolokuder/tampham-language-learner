Here are 30 multiple-choice questions to help you practice the grammar point of Unit 14, "I was doing (past continuous) and I did (past simple)," from the "Essential Grammar in Use" book [2, p. 37]. This unit focuses on comparing the use of the **past continuous** (was/were + -ing) for actions that were in progress at a specific time in the past, and the **past simple** for actions that were completed in the past [34, Section A, B].

The exercises often highlight situations where a longer action in the past continuous is interrupted by a shorter action in the past simple [34, Section A].
