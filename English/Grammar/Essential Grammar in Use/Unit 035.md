You're now moving on to Unit 35, which focuses on "**Would you like...? I'd like...**".

Here are the key grammar points from Unit 35 of "Essential Grammar in Use":

*   **"Would you like...?"** is used to:
    *   **Offer something** [74A]. For example, "**Would you like some coffee?**" [74A].
    *   **Invite somebody to do something** [74A]. For instance, "**Would you like to go for a walk?**" [74A].
    *   When responding, a common polite answer is "**Yes, please**" or "**No, thank you**" [74A].
*   **"I'd like..."** (which is a short form of **"I would like"**) is used to **express what you want** [74B]. It's considered a more polite way to say "I want" [74B].
    *   For example, if you are thirsty, you might say, "**I'd like a drink**" [74B].
    *   You can also use it to express a desire for an activity, such as "**I'd like to see the film on television this evening**" [74B].
*   It's important to differentiate "Would you like...?" from **"Do you like...?"** [74C].
    *   **"Do you like...?"** asks about your **general preference** or if you like something **in general** [74C]. For example, "**Do you like tea?**" asks if you generally enjoy tea [74C].
    *   **"Would you like...?"** is specifically used for an **offer or invitation** for a **specific occasion** [74C]. For example, "**Would you like some tea?**" is an offer of tea right now [74C].
    *   The book provides a comparison: "**Do you like oranges?**" (in general) versus "**Would you like an orange?**" (an offer) [74C].

    B) Would you like

    D) **Do you want**
    **Hint:** This asks about a general need, not an offer of something specific from the speaker, thus "do you want" is more appropriate than "would you like" in this context from the perspective of an everyday inquiry, although "Would you like anything?" could be an offer. Given the choices and the contrast in Unit 35, "Do you want" is the closer alternative for a general inquiry of need. (Note: "Do you want" is not explicitly contrasted with "Would you like" in Unit 35's core explanation, but it fits the context of asking about needs/preferences more generally than an offer).
    ****Correct Answer:**** B) Would you like (Upon re-evaluating strictly by Unit 35, "Would you like anything?" can be interpreted as an offer to get something *for them* from the shop. If it were asking about their general preference, "Do you like" would be the answer, but in this context, it's an offer.)
